# Programming-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This project is a Programming Assignment from the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data". It works with a dataset extracted from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The link to download the data is:

The link of the webpage from where the data was extracted is:

The represent data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This project cleans and runs a simple analysis on this Human Activity recognition dataset.

The R code "run_analysis_final.R" performs a simple data preparation and follows the 5 steps required in the Programming Assignment, as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository also contains a CodeBook that explains the codes and files used.
